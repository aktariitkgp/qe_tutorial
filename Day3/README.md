# Exercises

 - [Exercise 1](1_ozone_kcp/README.md): Compute the electronic strcture of the O<sub>3</sub> molecule at the KI level using the `koopmans` package and the `kcp.x` code
 - [Exercise 2](2_Si_kcp/README.md): Use the `koopmans` package and the `kcp.x` code to compute the KI band structure of FCC Si 
 - [Exercise 3](3_ozone_kcw/README.md): Use kcw.x to compute the KI band structure of the O<sub>3</sub> molecule
 - [Exercise 4](4_Si_kcw/README.md): Use `kcw.x` to compute the KI electronic structure of bulk Silicon. 
 - [Exercise 5](5_Zno_kcw/README.md): Use `kcw.x` to compute the KI electronic structure of bulk Silicon

Inside each folder you'll find the inputs file to run the calculations and a "reference" folder with reference output files.
