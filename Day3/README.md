# Exercises

 - [Exercise 1](1_ozone_kcw/README.md): Compute the electronic strcture of the O<sub>3</sub> molecule at the KI level
 - [Exercise 2](2_Si_kcw/README.md): Use kcw.x to compute the KI band structure of FCC Si 
 - [Exercise 3](3_Zno_kcw/README.md): Use kcw.x to compute the KI band structure of Wurzite ZnO
 - [Exercise 4](4_ozone_kcp/README.md): Use the `koopmans` package and the kcp code to compute the KI and KIPZ electronic structure of O<sub>3</sub>
 - [Exercise 5](5_Si_kcp/README.md): Use the `koopmans` package and the kcp code to compute the KI and KIPZ electronic structure of FCC Si

Inside each folder you'll find the inputs file to run the calculations and a "reference" folder with reference output files.
